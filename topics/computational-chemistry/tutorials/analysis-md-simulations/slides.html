# What is MD analysis?

---

![](images/platform_overview.png)
- Using outputs from MD simulations to look for trends in physical and chemical behaviour. 
- Timeseries analysis, distribution and correlation analysis are popular.

---

# Tools

- VMD (builtin plugins and custom scripts)
- MDAnalysis
- MDTraj
- Bio3D

# Tools that are in BRIDGE
- Bio3d suite (PCA etc.)
- MDAnalysis suite (timeseries etc.)
- MDTraj

- Root mean square deviation of atomic positions.

# RMSF - Root Mean Square Fluctuation
.pull-left[
- A measure of conformational variance. Can be linked to spectroscopic outcomes (experimental).

$$ f_i=\sqrt{(1/(M-1))\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\vert\vert r_i^{j}-r_i^i{0} \vert\vert ^{2})} $$

, where f_i is the RMSF value for the ith atom, M the total number of frames (total number of rows of xyz), r_i^j the positional vector of the ith atom in the jth frame, and r_i^0 the mean position of ith atom. ||r|| denotes the Euclidean norm of the vector r.

## PCA - Principal Component Analysis
.pull-left[
 - Convert from a set of correlated observations (movement of all atoms in protein) to a set of principal components which are linearly independent (or uncorrelated).
 - The first principal component has the highest variance and so on. 
 - Useful to find important modes of the protein.
