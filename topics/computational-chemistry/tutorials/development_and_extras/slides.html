## IN DEVELOPMENT

---

### Overview

A brief overview of tools development and other exciting things that can be done.

- Jupyter 
- Automation against server
- New tools development

---

### Why use Jupyter

- keep data and do visualization on the server
- try out ideas (esp. where tools do not exist)
- alternatively work in a JupyterHub elsewhere and move to Galaxy when ready

---

### Scripting for Automation
- Form filling can get tedious
- Have multiple ideas to try and can automate them. 
- Will still require human interaction but can more efficiently create multiple systems.
- Use Bioblend ([Github](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend), [documentation](https://bioblend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_docs/galaxy/all.html))

---

### Tool development and contribution
- Use [planemo](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo)
- Look at examples: https://github.com/galaxycomputationalchemistry/galaxy-tools-compchem & 
- Simple tool example: https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/add-tool-tutorial/
