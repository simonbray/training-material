## Molecular formats supported

 
- PDB (by default)
- DCD (in the latest release, and special install) see https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/6613)
- Gromacs (in the latest release, and special install) see https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/6655
- crd/psf (manually added)

Add a new format:
 - create a pull request
 - add from the toolshed or, 
 - manually include a custom format file on your Galaxy instance.

### Visualisation inside Galaxy

Use [charts](https://galaxyproject.org/learn/visualization/charts/).
Currently only supports PDB

### Visualisation outside Galaxy
Will require downloading the dataset (!) - pdb,dcd or similar

- VMD*
- Avogadro
- Pymol
- Schrodinger Maestro

 Who has used VMD or similar ?

### Visualisation Best Practice

![](images/animation.gif)
- Use VMD for hands-on analysis
- For analysis on large datasets, data download is an issue.
- Complete analysis using tools in Galaxy (work with data directly on the server) then download image or raw results.

### Visualisation demo

Let's visualise a PDB together very quickly before starting simulations.

- [7CEL PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7CEL)
- import into Galaxy and charts view
- import into VMD and view
