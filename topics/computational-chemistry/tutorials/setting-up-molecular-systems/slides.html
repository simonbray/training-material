# Setting up molecular systems
Can be challenging!
- Protonation states
- Mutations
- Simulation boxes and imaging
- Solvent
- MD (classical mechanics), QM (quantum), mixed 
- Free energy?

---

# Tools that can be used

- Packmol 
- CHARMM
- Schrodinger (Homology modelling, pKa prediction etc.)
- [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/all)
- AMBER and Antechamber etc.

# Usecase : Cellulase 

Cellulose, the Î²-1,4-linked straight chain homopolymer of glucose, plays a key structural role in plants as a component of lignocellulose (along with hemicellulose and lignin) and is the most abundant organic compound in the biosphere. This abundance has made it a key target for a source to produce biofuels such as ethanol.

- Enzyme: 7CEL a cellobiose hydrolase that cleaves every second glycosidic linkage from a cellulose chain to produce cellobiose
- Substrate: 'octaose' - a short chain of cellulose polymer (glucose-b1-4-glucose homopolymer)
- Solvent: Water
- Aim: Simulate the cellulase protein using freely available tools. 
CHARMM wrappers are available, but not used here as CHARMM is not freely available.

# Process
- Use CHARMM-GUI for setup

---

- Use BRIDGE for simulations
