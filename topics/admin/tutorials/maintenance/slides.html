# Runaway Storage

Tips:
- Set quotas
- `tmpwatch` your job working directory
  - `cleanup_job` in `galaxy.yml` (defaults to `always` though)
- Set up dataset cleanup

---
# Dataset Cleanup

- `scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py`: PostgreSQL-optimized fast cleanup script
- `scripts/cleanup_datasets/cleanup_datasets.py`: General cleanup script
- `gxadmin cleanup 30`: calls pgcleanup

# Dataset Cleanup Lifecycle

Mark deleted all "anonymous" histories not used within the last `$days` days:

```console
python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py \
    -o $days -s delete_userless_histories
```

Remove all history exports older than `$days` days:

```console
python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py \
    -o $days -s delete_exported_histories
```

Mark purged HDAs in histories deleted `$days` or more days ago (not user-recoverable):

```console
python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py \
    -o $days -s purge_deleted_histories
```

# Dataset Cleanup Lifecycle

Mark purged individual HDAs deleted `$days` or more days ago (not user-recoverable):

```console
python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py \
    -o $days -s purge_deleted_hdas
```

Mark datasets with all purged HDAs last updated `$days` or more days ago deleted:

```console
python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py \
    -o $days -s delete_datasets
```

Mark purged all datasets last updated `$days` or more days ago **and remove from disk**:

```console
python ./scripts/cleanup_datasets/pgcleanup.py \
    -o $days -s purge_datasets
```

# Backups

What to back up:
- Configs (done with Ansible)
- Database
- Installed shed tools and dependencies
- Datasets (if you can...)

What not to back up:

- Anything in `database/` not mentioned above
- Job working directories
