## ChIP-seq

- **Ch**romatin **I**mmuno**P**recipitation combined with **seq**uencing
- Identifying the location of proteins binding sites
    - Transcription Factors
    - Histone modifications
- 2 Types of sequenced data
    - ChIP data
    - Input data

???
We probe a potential architectural role for SMCHD1 and investigate the mechanism by which it shapes the Xi and represses gene expression
